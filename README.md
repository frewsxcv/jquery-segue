# jQuery-segue

This was originally a project to do lazy-loading for images with jQuery, but then I found out about [unveil](https://github.com/luis-almeida/unveil) and [lazyload](https://github.com/vvo/lazyload). I might delete this project in the future (considering it's not a very mature project), but for now exists for archival purposes.
